### Hi, I'm Jagan 👋

I'm a data scientist and a writer. 
Welcome to my rabbit-hole. Here I share my musings on data, trends and things I find interesting. 

- 🎓 I read a lot!. I'm currently open-sourcing my notes on the (technical) books I've read [here](https://fast-second.github.io/fast-second). Some are already in [progress](https://github.com/convolversandtransformers/homl2)!
- 🔭 I'm best reached via [email](jagans94@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
